				<p>The Town of Warren Fire Department has been providing emergency service to our residents since 1802. The primary mission
				of our fire department is safeguarding and preserving life and property against the elements of fire and disaster.
				Unattended cooking and careless smoking continue to be the leading causes of fire but due to the dedication of our
				volunteers, the property loss has been minimized. The fire department has an operating strength of 75 members and serves a
				population of more than 11,000 citizens. The department operates from five stations that provide services to the
				residential, business, and industrial complexes throughout the town. All of our personnel receive ongoing training to meet
				the town’s high expectations. Training is one of our leading priorities, as it refines firefighter skills and enhances the
				safety of our citizens. The Fire Department continues to conduct proactive inspections of our businesses and industrial
				complexes to ensure code compliance. The goal of the Fire department is to assist our business merchants with enhancing the
				safety of their facilities. Our members also offer public safety talks as well as training in the use of portable fire
				extinguishers. The fire department continues to maintain an aggressive approach to pursue all grants that will assist us in
				performing our mission. We have been successful recently in being awarded several Federal Grants to increase personnel as
				well as receiving grants for fire apparatus, vehicle exhaust systems, and the complete upgrade of our self-contained
				breathing apparatus. Finally, I would like to commend our personnel for their dedication and tireless efforts in helping to
				keep our community safe.</p>
